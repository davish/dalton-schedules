# dalton-schedules
API wrapper for retrieving student and teacher schedules at the Dalton School.

For many of the tests in `schedules.py`, a user and password from the Dalton system is necessary. Create a `credentials.py` file and declare two variables, `username` and `password`, whose values are your username and password. This is in the gitignore, and should not leave one's computer.

Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
